## Description:
This is a Python Flappy Bird game that has almost all of the features that the original Flappy Bird game did have. Some of the more complicated aspects of this program is its collision detection system, animation use, object-oriented class use, and call to online images for the graphics

## Important Notes:
The code below does make calls to online images for the graphics, and wifi is needed in order for the program to run

## Personal Best Score:
